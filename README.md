# Score_Management_System
Q: What's the system aims for?
A: This system is the design homework of an HEU student. He asked me to do his homework. So I wrote this repo.

Q: Why there are so many Chinese comments in the code? That's not your style.
A: This is not the code writing for myself. Client needs to read the comment easily. So I have to accommodate myself to his poor English level.

Q: Why you do this? He should do his own homework!
A: Actually I take this work as a practice for myself. Our school don't assign design homework to freshman. However most colleges assign at least one design homework. I use this chance to make up this missing lesson. What about him? He offered me this chance to practice, so why I still need to take care of his skill increment?
